Let's make Twitter fun again! Block Party auto-blocks abusive users so you can focus on the important stuff.

Block Party analyzes your mentions for abusive language and automatically blocks any abusive user and remove their tweet from your timeline. We save a record of the trigger tweet in case you need it as evidence.

Block Party will never block a Twitter user that you follow, and we will never post a Tweet on your behalf.

If you aren't familiar with the problem of online harassment, on Twitter and other online spaces, this [Pacific Standard article by Amanda Hess](http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/women-arent-welcome-internet-72170/) is an excellent introduction to the issue.

This is my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (DC2).

## Technologies Used
- Block Party is built on Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. 
- Authentication through OAuth for Twitter.
- Byebug for debugging.
