*I built this version of Block Party in a few days in 2014 as my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (DC2). I'm now writing a more robust version of the app using NodeJS, Express, React, and the Twitter Streaming API.*

Let's make Twitter fun again! Block Party auto-blocks abusive users so you can focus on the important stuff.

Block Party analyzes your mentions for abusive language and automatically blocks any abusive user and remove their tweet from your timeline. Block Party will never block a Twitter user that you follow.

## Technologies Used
