# block party

Let's make Twitter fun again! Block Party auto-blocks abusive users so you can focus on the important stuff.

This is my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (DC2).

## Technologies Used
- Block Party is built on Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. 
- Authentication through OAuth for Twitter.
- Byebug for debugging.
